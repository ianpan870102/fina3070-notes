* The need of new capital
- Recall from Notes 4B, if a firm needs more capital, it can (ranked
  by level of *importance* (in the US)):
  1. Increase retained earnings: reduce div., or keep div. constant
     even when net income increased.
  2. New borrowing: private loans (bank loans), public bonds
     (straight, convertible)
  3. New shares: seasoned equity offering
* Capital Structure: 3 Schools of Thought
1. Trade-off Theory (strong form)
2. Pecking Order Theory (semi-strong form)
3. Stock Market Timing Theory (semi-strong inefficient)
* Trade-off Theory
- Assumes perfect market: strong form, **no tax**, no transaction cost
- Assumes zero-growth firm
  - dividend = net income
  - net cap. spending = depreciation
- Value of the firm is determined only by assets (PV, future cash
  flows), not capital structure (D/E).
  - $r_a$ is same for unleveraged firm (equity only) and leveraged
    firm (debt + equity). P.s. more leverage means more debt (higher
    D/E ratio).
  - $r_a = r_f + \beta_a(r_M - r_f)$
** Interest Tax Shield (no longer perfect market assumption)
- Logic: If a company has some debt (i.e. needs to pay annual
  interest), the interest is deducted from EBIT, resulting in a
  smaller pretax income, which means less tax to pay.
- Annual tax shield $= T_c \cdot D \cdot r_D$, where T_c is the
  corporate tax rate, and D is the total outstanding debt, and r_D is
  the interest rate. $D \cdot r_D$ together is the annual interest
  expense of the firm.
- Assuming zero-growth firm, the PV of future tax shields is
  $\frac{T_c \cdot D \cdot r_D}{r_D} = T_c \cdot D$
- Leveraged firm will have higher value than unleveraged firm
  - $V_L = V_U + T_c \cdot D$
- In reality, tax shield is limited by EBIT.
** Equity's decrease v.s. Debt's increase
- If tax rate T_c = 0:
  - E's decrease = D's increase
  - No. of outstanding shares decreases
  - Share price remains same.
- If tax rate T_c > 0:
  - E's decrease < D's increase
  - No. of outstanding shares decreases
  - Share price increases (due to present value of tax shield)
- However, if debt interest payout were *not* regarded as expenses for
  tax calculation, then company enjoys no more tax shield: E's
  decrease and D's increase will be the same, thus share prices
  remains same.
** Without v.s. With personal taxes
- The tax rates are different for different countries.
- Notations:
  - $V_U$: value of an unleveraged firm
  - $V_L$: value of an leveraged firm
  - $T_{PE}$: personal tax for equity income
  - $T_{PD}$: personal tax for debt income (interest)
- Without personal taxes (HK):
  - $V_U = \frac{E(EBIT) \cdot (1-T_c)}{r_a}$
  - $V_L = V_U + (1 - T_c) \cdot D$
- With personal taxes (US):
  - $V_U = \frac{E(EBIT) \cdot (1-T_c)(1-T_{PE})}{r_a}$
  - $V_L = V_U + (1- \frac{(1 - T_c)(1-T_{PE})}{(1-T_{PD})}) \cdot D$
** Two opposing forces
- 1. Corporate tax shield encourages debt financing (leverage)
- 2. Usually $T_{PD} > T_{PE}$, i.e. interest income tax rate $>$
  cap. gains tax rate.
  - According to the formula above, this will offset the financial
    leverage gain.
- Therefore, combining the two opposing forces, we have:
  - $0 <$ financial leverage gain $< T_C \cdot D$
** Trump's 2018 tax changes (Notes 6A pp.31) leads to:
- Stock index increase
- Smaller leverage advantage $\to$ less borrowing
** Agency problem of debt
*** Cause
- In a normal healthy firm, we accept projects that has "expected
  +NPV", and reject overly risky projects.
- However, *shareholders* in a distressed firm might prefer risky
  projects (-NPV), as this is the only way they "might" get
  paid. Recall that bond holders (creditors) also has higher priority.
  - This makes the bond holders unhappy, since the shareholders are
    essentially "gambling at the expense of lenders".
*** Solution
- When debt ratios rise, lenders can protect themselves against such
  gambles by imposing more "covenants" (= agreements).
- However, such covenants might cause constraints and inefficiencies.
*** Conclusion
- Such agency problems lead to "deadweight loss" in $V_L$ (leveraged
  firm).
