* The need of new capital
- Recall from Notes 4B, if a firm needs more capital, it can:
  1. Increase retained earnings: reduce div., or keep div. constant
     even when net income increased.
  2. New borrowing: private loans (bank loans), public bonds
     (straight, convertible)
  3. New shares: seasoned equity offering
