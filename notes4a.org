* True value of a bond
E.g. par = $100,000; maturity = 10 years; annual coupon 3%
(i.e. $3,000).
- True value = PAR(coupons) + PAH(par value)
- We use YTM of bonds of same rating as our r. Suppose it's 10%.
- $V = \sum_t \frac{3000}{(1.10)^t} + \frac{100,000}{(1.10)^{10}}
  \approx$ $57K.
- This is a "discount bond" because its true value $<$ par.
- Suppose we have a higher annual coupon rate s.t. the true value $>$
  par, then we have a "premium bond".
* Valuation of common stock
- Harder than valuation of bonds.
- Uncertain dividends.
- Hard to estimate "suitable discount rate".
* Three Different types of traders
- *Smart traders*: make use of public info (financial statements) to
  estimate true value of shares. E.g. mutual fund managers.
- *Noise traders*: only guessing. E.g. speculators.
- *Insiders*: information asymmetry. E.g. CEO, managers of the firm.
* Efficient-Market Hypothesis
- Observed market price of a common stock reflects the relevant
  information.
- Smart traders matter; noise traders don't matter; insiders trade
  infrequently.
- Don't have to estimate true value by ourselves: the market prices
  can already be trusted.
** Three forms of market efficiency
*** Semi-strong form
- Prices reflect all publicly available info.
- (Will be our focus of study.)
*** Weak form
- Prices reflect only a subset of public info. E.g. past trading information.
*** Strong form
- Prices reflect all info, including insider information.
** School of Efficient Market v.s. School of Behavioural Finance
- SEM believes that all bond (including investment-grade bonds and
  junk bonds) and stock are efficient; SBF thinks that junk bonds and
  common stocks are not efficient.
- Most people regard investment-grade bonds are efficient -- very easy
  to estimate true value. Almost strong-form efficient.
- Junk bonds (risk of default) and common stocks have more severe info asymmetry.
- Strong form doesn't hold for common stocks: empirical evidence shows
  that insiders can indeed make abnormal profit, meaning that insider
  info is not publicly available.
** Information asymmetry: HK v.s. US
- Definition: a manager knows the company better than smart traders do.
- More severe in HK than US:
  - Semi-annual financial report (HK) v.s. quarterly report (US).
  - Less detailed/reliable financial statements (HK) v.s. more
    detailed/reliable (US).
** When noise traders cause mispricing
- SEM: smart traders will use risky arbitrage to drive stock price
  back to true value per share immediately, eliminating any further
  profit opportunities.
- Risky arbitrage: buy under-priced stock by using capital from
  (short-)selling a "similar" fairly-priced stock; or buy
  fairly-priced stock by using capital from (short-)selling a
  "similar" over-priced stock.
- SBF: risky arbitrage might be costly and slow-working -- noise
  traders can cause mispricing/deviation of stock price from true
  value (in the short run).
** When new information comes in
- Suppose the arrival of new information that positively affects true
  value per share: smart analysts will compete and quickly buy the
  stock they believe is under-priced due to the new info. This active
  risky arbitrage will push price up till equilibrium.
- Market shall reach equilibrium before daily close (sometimes even
  just 1 hr after news arrival).
*** Event study: a tool to test semi-strong EMH
- Assess the impact of a specific event on a firm's stock price.
- Abnormal return due to the event is estimated as the difference
  between the stock's actual return and a proxy for the stock's return
  in the absence of the event.
  - The proxy is estimated by an index (e.g. Hang Seng Index).
- Abnormal return = actual return $-$ normal return
  - Normal return can be estimated as $\alpha + \beta r_m$, where
    $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are estimated from the data of day -120 up to
    day -20.
  - $r_m$ is calculated as daily return, i.e. $\frac{\text{price
    today}-\text{price yesterday}}{\text{price yesterday}}$.
  - Hence, abnormal return = actual return $- (\alpha + \beta r_m)$
**** Pattern of abnormal returns in "inefficient market"
- See graph in Notes4A pp.18
- It takes several days to go back to equilibrium -- market is slow to react.
*** ACAR (Average Cumulative Abnormal Return)
- Plot on Notes4A pp.20 has a high horizontal line after day 0,
  because it's cumulative.
**** Possible patterns of ACAR
- Normal: significant jump on day 0 (when the info arrives), and
  random prices changes (which is normal) afterwards:
  - Semi-strong efficient.
- Insider: if there's a jump before day 0 -- possible information
  leakage:
  - Evidence "against" strong form EMH.
- If price adjust slowly (slow reaction until horizontal line) or
  overreacts (overshoots) then corrects itself (drop back to high
  horizontal line):
  - Inefficient market.
* Seen One Bond, Seen Them All
- SEM and SBF both agree: no controversy.
- Horizontal demand curve: a commodity (e.g. newspaper) with close substitutes.
- Bonds with same rating are regarded by investors as close substitutes for one another.
- If a bond's true value is constant (no coupon rate change, same bond
  rating etc.), there will be horizontal demand curve even if the
  supply Q increases (shown in Notes4A pp.30)
- If Q's increase triggers P's decrease (s.t. P $<$ V), then risky
  arbitrage will correct it almost immediately.
* Seen One Stock, Seen Them All (controversial)
- This is an assumption by SEM only.
- The expected return of an individual stock can be "replicated" by a
  portfolio of stocks (i.e. no stock is unique: different stocks are
  close substitutes).
- SEM: horizontal demand curve.
- SBF: downward-sloping demand curve in the short run.
* Semi-strong efficiency: HK vs. US
- US stock market is more efficient than HK. China stock market is
  even less efficient.
- HK has more severe info asymmetry: harder to value a HK stock's true value.
- Risky arbitrage less active in HK than in US.
** Short-sales in "less allowed" in HK than in US
- Short-selling is legal only for approx. half of the main-board
  stocks in HK.
- Even for stocks that can be short-sold, "free float" is small (for a
  typical HK firm).
  - Free float: number of shares outstanding that are "not" held by
    controlling stockholders. Because those major stockholders don't
    hold to trade/sell.
  - Controlling stockers would obviously "not" lend shares for you to
    short-sell.
