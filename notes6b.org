* Trade-off Theory (continued)
- The *trade-off*: capital stucture; trade-off between tax shields &
  costs of financial distress.
- "Optimal debt ratio" varies from firm to firm:
  - Firms with *high EBIT* have *higher* optimal debt ratio; *later*
    turning point (Notes6B pp. 3); can enjoy *more tax shield*.
  - More tangible assets/collateral $\to$ low agency costs of debt,
    low bankraptcy costs, because lenders have more trust $\to$ also
    lead to *higher* optimal debt ratio.
- Since we assume strong-form efficiency, printing new shares (GCO)
  will not lead to price drop.
  - Contradicts the next 2 theories (pecking order theory & stock
    market timing theory).
** Empirical findings
*** Agreement & consistency with trade-off theory
- Airlines and utilities companies (more tangible assets,
  e.g. airplanes) indeed borrow more heavily (more debt).
- High-tech firms (risky intangible assets) use little debt.
- Firms react to credit rating
  - reduce leverage to save rating, by issuing new shares,
    constraining div., or selling assets (to pay creditors).
*** Contradictions to trade-off theory
- Most profitable companies often borrow the least!
  - P.s. this is consistent with Pecking order theory, our next topic.
* Pecking Order Theory
- Recall that on GCO announcment, the demand curve will shift down
  (stock price drops), due to info asymmetry (which will not happen in
  strong-form efficient market).
- *The Pecking Order* (applies to the US):
  1. internal equity first (no transaction costs of printing new shares)
  2. then straight bonds (no price drop).
  3. then convertible bonds (mild price drop).
  4. finally issue new shares (only when debt capacity is used up)
- Companies avoid GCO due to price drop on announcement.
  - The next theory (stock market timing) will contradict this.
** Empirical findings
- Pecking order solves the contradiction to
  trade-off theory, "Most profitable companies often borrow the
  least!"
  - Reasoning: Firms with smaller EBIT (less profitable) have *less
    internal equity*, hence need to borrow more.
** Differences to trade-off theory
- Unlike Trade-off, Pecking doesn't have well-defined target D/E
  ratio, and does not consider trade-off between tax shield and
  financial distress.
- Unlike Trade-off, Pecking divides equity into 2 kinds: internal and
  external.
- Pecking cannot explain the "tangible assets phenomenon"
  (e.g. airlines borrow more, tech companies borrow less etc.)
- Each theory can explain parts of the real world; neither is perfect
* Stock Market Timing Theory
- Semi-strong *inefficient*.
- In a bull market, the average price drop (3%) on GCO announcment is
  too small $\to$ value re-estimated by the market on GCO announcment
  is higher than actual true value, i.e. the market is
  optimistic. (negative abnormal return in the long run)
  - Encourages company to issue new shares via GCO.
- Empirical evidence:
  - Stock issues (GCO) concentrate in bull markets; share repurchases
    concetrate in bear markets.
* Comparing The Three School of Thoughts
- Regarding changes in capital structure in the short run:
  - Usual times: pecking order
  - Bull/bear times: stock market timing
- Regarding changes in capital structure in the long run:
  - In the long run, companies will have own target D/E ratio
  - Consistent with trade-off theory
