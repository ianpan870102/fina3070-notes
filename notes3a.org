* Discount Rate: r
** Use WACC
- r = WACC (weighted average cost of capital), which in turn is calculated by $E(r_{debt})$ and $E(r_{equity})$.
- Simple example: suppose firm's debt is 30% of firm's value at 7.5%
  (lower risk) and equity is 70% of firm's value at 15%.
  - Company cost of capital = 7.5 \times .3 + 15 \times .7 = 12.75%
- $E(r_{debt})$ is observable.
- But $E(r_{equity})$ (cost of equity) needs to be estimated -- the
  hardest part of calculating WACC.
*** The Company Cost of Capital
- = Expected return of a portfolio of existing securities of that
  company.
- = the opportunity cost of capital for investment in the company's assets.
- = the appropriate r for the company's average-risk projects.
- Estimated as a "blend" of "cost of debt" (interest rate) and "cost
  of equity" (expected rate of return demanded by investors in firm's
  common stock).
- If company has "no debt outstanding", then "company cost of capital"
  = "expected rate of return on the company's stock".
- E.g. suppose we know that a company's common stock has a beta of
  value $\beta$:
  - Company's $r = r_f + \beta(r_m - r_f)$
*** When Project's Risk $\approx$ Equity-Market's Risk
- Opportunity cost of capital.
- Suppose $E(r_m)$ is the current expected annual return of the equity market.
- If a new project's risk is similar to the stock market's average equity
  risk, then its "annual discount rate" should equal $E(r_m)$.
- We can estimate $E(r_m)$ using the current $r_f$ and historical
  average of differences between $r_m$ and $r_f$, which is $(r_m-r_f)$.
- I.e. $E(r_m) = r_f + E(r_m-r_f)$
- $r_f$ is the YTM of 1-year T-bill, will be in daily news.
- $E(r_m-r_f)$ is "market risk premium" (USA historically 7.7%).
*** When project's risk $\neq$ equity-market's risk
- We need a model to calculate project's suitable discount rate.
- E.g. CAPM (used by large firms and investors), APT, Fama-French 3-factor model.
* CAPM: Capital Asset Pricing Model
** Overview
- Risk: diversifiable risk and non-diversifiable (systematic) risk.
- The higher the systematic risk, the higher the required (expected)
  return.
- Even if a stock/project is very risk, if most of the risk is
  diversifiable, then it doesn't need a high discount rate.
** Non-diversifiable risk: $\beta$
- Systematic risk is the sensitivity towards change in macro-economy.
- The market portfolio is represented, in practice, by the S&P 500.
*** Understanding the scatter plots (Lec Ch7. p.13-15)
- The slope is the estimated beta.
- $R^2$ is the percentage of non-diversifiable risk in the total risk.
  - E.g. p.13 Right figure. $R^2$ is 0.15, this means that 15% of the
    total risk can be explained by market movement, while the rest 85%
    was diversifiable.
- The values in parentheses (under beta) are the standard errors of
  each estimation, representing the possible mismeasurement.
*** Beta formula for an example stock $i$
- $\beta_i = \dfrac{\text{covariance of stock i's return with the
  market return}}{\text{variance of the market return}} = \dfrac{\sigma_{i,m}}{\sigma_m^2}$.
*** Using regression to find beta
- $r_i (t) = \alpha + \beta_i r_m (t) + e_i (t)$
** TODO SCL (Security Characteristic Lines) (pp.20)
- Systematic (non-diversifiable) risk: explained by the SCL.
- Firm-specific (diversifiable) risk: unexplained by the SCL.
- $\sigma_i^2 = \beta_i^2 \cdot \sigma_m^2 + \sigma_{e_i}^2$
- Total risk = Systematic risk + Firm-specific (diversifiable) risk.
- R-square = $\dfrac{\text{systematic risk}}{\text{total risk}}$
** TODO ANOVA (pp.26-)
** TODO More on beta and r (last 10 pages)
