* When a (Listed) Company Needs New Capital
- Increase in "retained earnings": without printing new bonds/shares,
  a company can keep dividend constant when net income increases, or
  even reduce dividend.
- Raise new capital
  - New borrowing
    - Private loans: not to be traded (e.g. bank loans)
    - Public bonds: tradeable (straight/simple bonds, convertible bonds)
  - New shares
    - Seasoned equity offering: already listed company
    - P.s. unseasoned equity offering: IPO, i.e. private company
      becomes public (listed) company
* Debt Raising (Bond Issuing) By Listed Company
** Private Placement (not our focus)
- "Small" amount of borrowing from small number of "selected lenders".
- Raise loans from "commercial banks", or "rich individuals /
  institutional investors".
  - Common in both HK and US.
- Issue small number of bonds to investment banks to be resold to
  their clients.
  - Common in US, less common in HK.
** GCO (General Cash Offer)
- Issue "many" new bonds to the public.
- Common in US, less common in HK.
- Investment banks serve as "underwriters" (receive
  spread/compensation from company).
- Public announcement (optional: approval by special meeting of shareholders).
- Book-building (demand book) by i-bank underwriters
  - Invite many investors (small investors might not be invited).
  - Road shows: presentation explaining characteristics of new bond
    (share), e.g. coupon rate, YTM etc.
  - Collect "individual demand curves of each investor" $\to$ get
    aggregate demand curve.
  - Decide offering price (i.e. printing price, issue price).
- Issuing new bonds have lower GCO costs than issuing new shares.
* Book-Building: Slope of Individual and Aggregate Demand Curves
** Individual Demand Curve Slope
- Information asymmetry and difficulty of valuing the common stock:
  the more severe info asymmtery, the steeper the slope.
- Investors that are more risk-aversed (or with more capital
  constraint) have steeper slope. (Even if you lower the price, I'm
  still only willing to buy a small quantity.)
- Short sales contraints also steepen the slope.
** Aggregate Demand Curve Slope
- Horizontal summation of different investors' slopes. (see Notes4B pp.6)
* Bond Rating
** Seniority Declining
- Bonds issued earlier (senior bonds) have less default risk than
  junior bonds, which are issued more recently. Reason: Suppose for a
  specific the cash flow of a company is low, the senior bond-holders
  will receive their payments first.
- Senior bonds have higher bond rating (e.g. AAA) than junior bonds
  (e.g. A).
- Subscribers (investors) of the latest batch are
  'indifferent'. Because they pay a fair price (AA-grade price for
  AA-grade price bond).
- Seniority declining is more common, as early investors will demand
  this as a protection (to avoid being hurt later). Therefore, the
  outstanding bonds' price usually doesn't change even if new bonds
  are issued.
- However, the market price of the original batch (senior bonds) might
  still change (not because of the new bond issues, but because of the
  company's future performance).
** If No Seniority Declining (Notes4B pp.12)
- The company is 'happy' (more borrowing value with AA-grade price;
  calculate rectangle area).
- The earlier shareholders are 'unhappy' (suffer capital loss).
- Subscribers (investors) of the latest batch are
  'indifferent'. Because they pay a fair price (AA-grade price for
  AA-grade price bond).
** Misc.
- If a firm issues more 'straight' bonds, the stock price usually
  doesn't change.
- Thus, raising new capital is considered 'neutral news'.
* Equity Raising (Stock Issuing) By Listed Company
** Placing / Private Placement
- A small number of new shares to a small number of big investors.
- Common in HK, less common in US.
** GCO
- Lots of new shares to the public, through i-banks.
- Common only in US.
** Rights Offering
- Lots of new shares issued on a 'pro rata (proportional) basis' to
  'current' stockholders. (E.g. a current stockholder holding 1% of
  existing shares will subscribe to 1% of the newly shares to be
  issued.)
  - Current stockholders can also choose to 'give up' such right.
- The percentage ownership won't be affected by the newly issued
  stocks: important for closesly-held companies (e.g. in HK, UK,
  Europe).
- No book-building necessary (the demand is fixed proportionally
  anyways.)
- One underwriter to subscribe to the shares given up by shareholders.
* Private Placement
** HK vs US
- The big investors & offering price (P_{issue}) are decided by a
  process of 'book-building'.
  - Likely in HK and US.
- The big investors are already selected by the company (e.g. close
  friends of controlling stockholder) with a much lower $P_{issue}$.
  - Possible in HK.
** How V may change
- Suppose $V_0$ and $P_0$ stand for the true value and market price
  of a stock before a private placement issue, and $V_1$ and $P_1$
  stand for the value and price afterwards.
- $V_0 = P_0$ and $V_1 = P_1$.
- True value ($V_1$) might change after the news of private placment issue.
*** Private placement as a good news
- If the big investor is knowledgeable and famous, e.g. Warren Buffet.
- If the 'issue price discount' is 'small' (the investor only asks for
  a small price discount). I.e. $P_{issue}$ is only a bit below $P_0$.
  - Probably because the investor has some insider info, e.g. factory visit.
- $P_1=V_1 > P_0=V_0$
*** Private placement as a bad news
- If the 'issue price discount' is big. I.e. $P_{issue}$ is way below $P_0$.
- $P_1=V_1 < P_0=V_0$
- A possible scenario in HK:
  - E.g. the investor is a close friend of the controlling
    stockholder, and receives the benefit of a big price discount --
    bad news for corporate governance; hurts other stockholders.
* GCO: General Cash Offer
- Stock price usually 'drops' on the (equity) GCO announcement: the
  stock demand curve 'shifts' down (slope unchanged).
  day. However, as previously mentioned, there's no price drop if it's
  straight-bond GCO.
  - 'Capital raising' itself is neutral news. It's 'printing new
    shares' that has an averse effect on stock price.
- Aggregate demand curve is (almost) horizontal: because there's a lot
  of investors to be horizontally summed.
** EPS (Earning Per Share) Dilution (value reduction): An Incorrect Concept
- Intuitively, people may think that EPS will drop after issuing new
  shares, consequently leading to a drop of stock market price P.
- In reality, share price "may or may not" change -- it depends on the
  EPS expected by the market:
  - Expected EPS will actually increase if the market believes that
    new shares are used for +NPV projects, because earnings may go
    up. (Similarly, EPS will drop if market believes the project is
    -NPV).
** Information asymmetry scenarios
*** Stock market timing
- Suppose the company needs new long-term capital. Will it choose to
  issue new shares GCO or new bonds GCO?
- It depends on the timing!
  - If the market stock price is lower than manager's insider true
    value estimation: it's better to issue new bonds.
  - If the market stock price is higher than manager's insider true
    value estimation: then of course it's better for the company to
    issue new shares.
- Therefore, the share price will drop on the announcement of new
  shares GCO -- the public now knows that the market stock price is
  higher than true value.
- So technically, the manager doesn't have that much of an advantage
  with insider info.
*** New capital as working capital or to finance +NPV projects
- If the new capital needed by the company is for working capital
  (i.e. to keep the business running):
  - Issue new shares; avoid extra coupon burden.
- If the new capital is for financing +NPV projects:
  - Either new shares or bonds are fine.
** How much is the value drop upon shares GCO announcement?
- The amount of value drop depends on "how severe the info asymmetry" is.
- In US, on average:
  - 3% for industrial companies (more fluctuating profits)
  - 0.9% for utilities companies: e.g. electricity,
    energy. (Regulated, less info asymmetry)
- If HK allows shares GCO, the price drop should be even bigger -- HK
  has more severe info asymmetry
* Rights Offering
** Quick Review...
- Lots of new shares issued on 'pro rata basis': percentage
  ownership remain constant.
- Current stockholders can also choose to 'give up' such right.
- Common in HK & Europe because of closely-held companies. (Not
  common in US.)
- No book-building necessary.
- One underwriter to subscribe to the shares given up by shareholders.
** Two type of rights offering
1. "Rights issue" with rights market: stockholder can sell rights, in
   addition to exercising or giving up.
2. "Open offer" without rights market: stockholder can only either
   exercise or give up.
** Timeline & rundown
- Announcement fo rights offering + shareholders' special meeting
- Ex-rights day (ca. 1 month after announcement)
  - Price before rights offering: $P_c$ cum-rights shares.
  - Price after rights offering: $P_e$ ex-rights shares.
- Rights market begin till end (< 2-week duration)
- Closing date for exercising rights (ca. 2 months after announcement)
  - [def] exercising rights: sending the rights to the company, paying
    the exercise price, and receiving new shares.
** $P_e$ Calculation: Ex-rights adjustment in stock price
*** Method 1. Textbook approach
- Given rights issue ratio (e.g. 1-to-8), $P_c$ cum-rights price, and
  exercise price (i.e. offer price, issue price, subscription
  price). Find $P_e$ ex-rights share price (i.e. fair value of share
  on ex-rights day).
- Calculation rationale: An investor has one of two ways to own 9
  shares, and they should have the same cost.
  - Method 1: Buy 8 cum-rights shares (becoming a 'current investor'
    with rights) and subscribe 1 new share by exercising right = $8
    \cdot P_c + \text{exercise price}$
  - Method 2: Buy 9 ex-right shares = $9 \cdot P_e$
  - In an efficient market, the two methods must have "same cost".
  - Therefore, $P_e = \dfrac{8 \cdot P_c + \text{exercise price}}{9}$
*** Method 2. Balance-sheet approach
- Assume the same ratio, cum-rights price etc. from the example above,
  plus the following data:
  - Original num of shares outstanding = 8M
- Our deduction:
  1) Original total market value of equity = 8M $\cdot P_c$
  2) Proceeds from new rights shares = 1M $\cdot P_e$
  3) Final total market value of equity = $8M \cdot P_c + 1M \cdot P_e$
  4) Final num of shares outstanding = 9M
  5) Ex-rights price $P_e =$ (3.) / (4.) $= \dfrac{8M \cdot P_c + 1M
     \cdot P_e}{9M}$
** Value of a right
- Now that we have $P_e$ (ex-rights stock price), the value of a right
  = $P_e -$ exercise price.
- Alternatively, value of a right = $(P_c - P_e) \cdot 8$
** Two scenarios of ignoring a right
*** Possible in HK:
- Simply ignore, receive no extra cash payment.
*** In UK (Europe):
- Motivation: to protect shareholders with rights but plans to ignore.
- The ignored shares will be placed to a "new shareholder", who will
  pay the "value of the ignored right" to the original shareholder
  with rights.
