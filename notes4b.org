* When A (Listed) Company Needs New Capital
- Increase in "retained earnings": without printing new bonds/shares,
  a company can keep dividend constant when net income increases, or
  even reduce dividend.
- Raise new capital
  - New borrowing
    - Private loans: not to be traded (e.g. bank loans)
    - Public bonds: tradeable (straight/simple bonds, convertible bonds)
  - New shares
    - Seasoned equity offering: already listed company
    - P.s. unseasoned equity offering: IPO, i.e. private company
      becomes public (listed) company
* Debt Raising (Bond Issuing) By Listed Company
** Private Placement (not our focus)
- "Small" amount of borrowing from small number of "selected lenders".
- Raise loans from "commercial banks", or "rich individuals /
  institutional investors".
  - Common in both HK and US.
- Issue small number of bonds to investment banks to be resold to
  their clients.
  - Common in US, less common in HK.
** GCO (General Cash Offer)
- Issue "many" new bonds to the public.
- Common in US, less common in HK.
- Investment banks serve as "underwriters" (receive
  spread/compensation from company).
- Public announcement (optional: approval by special meeting of shareholders).
- Book-building (demand book) by i-bank underwriters
  - Invite many investors (small investors might not be invited).
  - Road shows: presentation explaining characteristics of new bond
    (share), e.g. coupon rate, YTM etc.
  - Collect "individual demand curves of each investor" $\to$ get
    aggregate demand curve.
  - Decide offering price (i.e. printing price, issue price).
- Issuing new bonds have lower GCO costs than issuing new shares.
* Book-Building: Slope of Individual and Aggregate Demand Curves
** Individual Demand Curve Slope
- Information asymmetry and difficulty of valuing the common stock:
  the more severe info asymmtery, the steeper the slope.
- Investors that are more risk-aversed (or with more capital
  constraint) have steeper slope. (Even if you lower the price, I'm
  still only willing to buy a small quantity.)
- Short sales contraints also steepen the slope.
** Aggregate Demand Curve Slope
- Horizontal summation of different investors' slopes. (see Notes4B pp.6)
* Bond Rating
** Seniority Declining
- Bonds issued earlier (senior bonds) have less default risk than
  junior bonds, which are issued more recently. Reason: Suppose for a
  specific the cash flow of a company is low, the senior bond-holders
  will receive their payments first.
- Senior bonds have higher bond rating (e.g. AAA) than junior bonds
  (e.g. A).
- Subscribers (investors) of the latest batch are
  'indifferent'. Because they pay a fair price (AA-grade price for
  AA-grade price bond).
- Seniority declining is more common, as early investors will demand
  this as a protection (to avoid being hurt later). Therefore, the
  outstanding bonds' price usually doesn't change even if new bonds
  are issued.
- However, the market price of the original batch (senior bonds) might
  still change (not because of the new bond issues, but because of the
  company's future performance).
** If No Seniority Declining (Notes4B pp.12)
- The company is 'happy' (more borrowing value with AA-grade price;
  calculate rectangle area).
- The earlier shareholders are 'unhappy' (suffer capital loss).
- Subscribers (investors) of the latest batch are
  'indifferent'. Because they pay a fair price (AA-grade price for
  AA-grade price bond).
** Misc.
- If a firm issues more 'straight' bonds, the stock price usually
  doesn't change.
- Thus, raising new capital is considered 'neutral news'.
* Equity Raising (Stock Issuing) By Listed Company
** Placing / Private Placement
- A small number of new shares to a small number of big investors.
- Common in HK, less common in US.
** GCO
- Lots of new shares to the public, through i-banks.
- Common only in US.
** Rights Offering
- Lots of new shares issued on a 'pro rata (proportional) basis' to
  'current' stockholders. (E.g. a current stockholder holding 1% of
  existing shares will subscribe to 1% of the newly shares to be
  issued.)
  - Current stockholders can also choose to 'give up' such right.
- The percentage ownership won't be affected by the newly issued
  stocks: important for closesly-held companies (e.g. in HK, UK,
  Europe).
- No book-building necessary (the demand is fixed proportionally
  anyways.)
