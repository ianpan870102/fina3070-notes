* Dividend Policy in perfect market
** How much to pay?
- Residual (leftover) dividend policy
*** Example
- Need 5 mil for new projects (+NPV).
- Cap. structure: dept/equity = 2/3 (ratio)
- Net income: 4 mil.
- *How to calculate dividend?*
  1. 40% project to be financed with new debt (bond): 2 mil
  2. 60% project to be financed with new equity: 3 mil
  3. Net income - equity needed = 1 mil: that's the amount to be
     paid out as dividend, or stock repurchase.
** How to pay?
- Cash dividend v.s. stock repurchase
* Cash Dividend v.s. Stock Repurchase
** Cash Dividend
- Important: Stock prices drops after ex-dividend date ($P_c > P_e$)!
- Ex-dividend date:
  - Cum-dividend stock price $P_c$ $>$ ex-dividend stock price $P_e$
  - Ex-dividend investors pay less for their stock, but can't receive
    dividends.
- Dividend per share (DPS): $P_c - P_e$
  - also equals: $\frac{\text{total dividend to be paid
    out}}{\text{no. of outstanding shares}}$
- Other numbers:
  - Total market cap. = Asset - liab.
  - $P_c = \frac{\text{Total market cap.}}{\text{no. of outstanding
    shares}}$
** Stock Repurchase
- Important: Stock price remains same after repurchase.
- If perfect market:
  - symmetric info
  - stock repurchase price $=$ normal price ($P_c$ in cash dividend scenario)
    - Because *both* the total market cap. (i.e. asset - liab.) and
      no. of outstanding shares decreases.
- About the investors who chose to sell back to company:
  - Indifferent about the action (because price is fair)
  - Motivation: need to liquidate, maybe for own cash use (pay kids'
    tuition fee).
  - Percentage ownership drops.
** Graph comparison on Notes5 pp.14
- Important: 2 rectangles (market cap. after payout) have same area!
  - Because both mechanisms pay out same amount of cash (which is the
    area of pp.12 minus pp.14)
- Cash dividend:
  - quantity (no. of shares outstanding) doesn't change
  - price drops
- Stock repurchase:
  - price doesn't change
  - quantity (no. of shares outstanding) drops
** More comparison
- Between the 2 mechanisms, the business itself (its beta) and
  $E(r_e)$ remains constant.
- Where's the difference? The dividend yield vs. cap. gains yield
  trade-off
- $E(r_e) = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g$, where
  - $\frac{D_1}{P_0}$ is the dividend yield
    - In cash dividend mechanism: positive $=E(r_e)$
    - In stock repurchase mechanism: zero ($D_0 =0$)
  - $g$ is dividend growth rate $=$ cap. gains (constant growth)
    - In cash dividend mechanism: smaller (obviously, cap. gains is
      smaller, because every ex-dividend date the price will drop)
    - In stock repurchase mechanism: positive $= E(r_e)$
- Investors should be *indifferent* between the 2 mechanisms, because
  $E(r_e)$ is the same anyways. Only difference is the trade-off of
  dividend yield vs. cap. gains yield (dividend growth).
** Conclusion
- If perfect market, dividend policy is irrelevant: choosing either
  doesn't matter.
** Taxes of dividends & cap. gain
- Question: Is the formula $P_c - P_e =$ dividend (D) correct?
  - Yes in HK, where tax of cap. gain ($t_{cg}$) $=$ tax of
    dividend ($t_d$) $= 0$.
  - No in USA, where $t_{cg} < t_d$
    - We need this formula: $(P_c - P_e) \cdot (1-t_{cg}) = D (1-t_d)$
*** HK & US preferences
- US: Recently (esp. after 1983 when law relaxes), stock repurchases
  in US have grown popular.
  - Main reason: **tax advantages**. Companies want to make
    shareholders happy, since $t_{cg} < t_d$.
  - Remember that stock repurchases yield higher cap. gain.
- HK: Cash dividend is more popular because the stock repurchase
  mechanism can be quite cumbersome.
*** Bush 2003, Obama 2013, & Trump 2018
- In 2003, President Bush reduced max $t_d$ to be 15% (same as max
  $t_{cg}$, which has long been 15%).
- Microsoft starts to pay cash dividends (for the first time in
  history).
- *However*, $t_{cg}$ still has an advantage over $t_d$!
- *This is due to the timing of when the taxes are paid, $PV(t_{cg})$
  is still smaller than $PV(t_d)$*.
- In 2013, Obama raised both max $t_d$ and max $t_{cg}$ from 15% to
  23.8%.
- In 2018, Trump reduced corporate tax rate & individual ordinary
  income tax rate. (max $t_d$ & max $t_{cg}$ remain 23.8%)
** Why do companies still pay some dividends? Why not always stock repurchase?
- Dividends (regular) are more like promises, and are generally more
  stable than stock repurchases (irregular).
- *Some investors* (high-income ones) prefer growth stocks (big
  cap. gain (dividend growth), less cash dividends)
  - They don't want to pay high tax of div.
- *Other investors* (lower-income ones, retirees, pension funds, or
  tax-exempt investors) prefer income stocks (high div. payout)
** Compromise dividend policy
- Residual dividend policy is for long-term (to determine long-term
  regular div. payout ratio)
  - Because short-term time-varying dividends might disturb clientele
    and have misleading signals.
- In short-term, we need "compromise dividend policy".
  - Company can borrow cash to pay out div. (not too often though,
    obviously.)
*** Order of importance (lower goals can deviate)
- Avoid cutting back on +NPV projects
- Avoid cuts in regular div. (DPS: div. per share)
- Avoid issuing new equity
- Maintain debt/equity ratio
- Maintain div. payout ratio
*** Industry life cycle
- Newly listed company should have zero or low regular dividend.
- The more mature it gets, it can start to increase regular dividend.
** More on Stock Repurchases
- The following applies for the US.
- Announcement of stock repurchase results in stock price increase (2%
  CAR, cumulative abnormal return)
- Tender offer (special stock repurchase): company announces to
  repurchase at 20% premium stock price. However, we observe only 11%
  stock price increase, why?
  1. Why not 2%? Well, because 20% is a lot above 2%.
  2. Why not 20% to "fix arbitrage" (buy at 11% and sell at 20%)?
     Because it's not real arbitrage since the tender offer quantity
     is actually pretty low.
