* PV vs. NPV
** PV
- Expected cash flows in the future.
- Value of a new project.
- Calculated using Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
** NPV
- Value of a new project 'minus' the 'initial cost' or cash outflow.
- NPV is PV minus initial cost.
- The company needs to forecast the project's cash flows and discount
  them at the opportunity cost of capital to arrive at the project's
  NPV.
- A project with a positive NPV increases shareholder value.
- Financing costs (interest payment, repayment of principle,
  dividends) and tax shields from interest are automatically
  considered when we discount the cash flows with discount rate.
- $NPV = \sum \dfrac{C_t}{(1 + r_t)^t}$
- , where $C$ (including initial negative $C_0$) is cash flow and
  $r_t$ is annual discount rate (in this chapter the discount rate is
  constant).
* Operating cash flow vs. Net cash flow
- Net cash flow = Operating cash flow $-$ after-tax asset purchase +
  after-tax asset disposal $-$ change in net working captial.
  - where after-tax asset purchase and after-tax asset disposal is
    often grouped into the same section (net capital spending).
  - Operatinng cash flow is calculated as EBIT + depreciation $-$ taxes.
* Sales vs. EBIT (Pre-tax profit) vs. Operating cash flow
- EBIT = Sales $-$ operating costs (including depreciation, calculated
  according to tax law).
- Tax on operations = EBIT \times tax rate.
- Operating cash flow = EBIT $-$ tax on operations + depreciation
  - We add back depreciation to calculate cash flows.
  - Fixed asset purchase is cash outflow.
  - After-tax cash flow from disposal of asset at project end =
    (expected salvage value of used asset) $-$ (tax rate \times
    (expected salvage value $-$ book value))
    - Book value = initial cost $-$ accumulated depreciation
    - We expect tax refund if expected salvage value is less than book value.
